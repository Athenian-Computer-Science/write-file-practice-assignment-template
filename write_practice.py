# Use this file to practice writing to files and appending to them

# writing to empty file
# Open the file text.txt and write a short sentence to it.
# Note: files can be opened in read ('r'), write ('w') or append ('a') modes. Default is read-only.
# Also note - you can only write strings this way. Data will need to be converted to str format.





# Note that running this creates the file and then adds your sentence.
# Open the file (by clicking on it) to be sure your sentence is there.


# Writing multiple lines
# Reopen the file and write at least 2 lines to it




# Check the file. Note that all lines are stuck together. Add \n to the ends!




# write as many lines as desired but must be before closing file


# Appending to file
# Open the file again, using 'a' instead of 'w' and then append at least 2 lines to it.
# Check the file. Does it look like it should? Adjust the formatting as needed.
